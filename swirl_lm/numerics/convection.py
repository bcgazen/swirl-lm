  The Rhie-Chow correction is enforced to remove the numerical fluctuation due

  cell-centered values onto cell faces, the Rhie-Chow correction is
  enforced [1].

  If a source term is provided, it would be included as an additional correction
  term [2]. For an arbitrary source term s, the correction at face i - 1/2
  (taking the x direction as an example) is performed as:

    u_{i - 1/2} = 0.5 (u_{i - 1} + u_{i}) - 0.5 (s_{i - 1} + s_{i}) +
      0.5 (s_{i - 1} + 0.5 dx ((s_{i} - s_{i - 2}) / (2 dx)) +

        0.125 (-s_{i - 2} + s_{i - 1} + s_{i} - s_{i + 1})
  To be consistent with the pressure correction term in terms of storage, node i
  stores information on the i - 1/2 face in the kernel implementation, which is:

  f_{i, j} = -s_{i-2, j} + s_{i-1, j} + s_{i, j} - s_{i+1, j}.
