  conditions to be correctly applied.

  Args:
    z_list: A list of length nz of tensors of shape (nx, ny), where nx, ny and
      nz are the number of points along the axes of a (sub)grid.
    dim: The dimension of `z_list` in which halo exchange will be performed.
      Must be one of 0, 1 or 2 for x, y or z, respectively.
    replica_id: The replica id.
    replicas: A numpy array of replicas.
    replica_dim: The dimension of `replicas` along which the halo exchange is to
      be performed.
    periodic: Indicates whether the given dimension should be treated
      periodically.
    bc_low: The boundary condition for the low side of the axis. This is either
      `None` or of the form `(bc_type, bc_value)` where `bc_value` represents a
      single 2D plane and is either a 2D tensor of shape (nx, xy) or a sequence

      `inplace_halo_exchange` for more details about boundary condition
      specifications.
    bc_high: The boundary condition for the high side of the axis. See `bc_low`.
    width: The halo width.
    plane: Which plane to exchange. This is the index relative to a set of
      low-side boundary planes. (The corresponding index for a set of high-side
      boundary planes is calculated.) This function must be called in order from
      `plane = width - 1` to `plane = 0` for Neumann boundary conditions to be
      correctly applied.
    left_or_top_padding: The amount of left or top padding, where left and top
      refer to the 2d plane formed by dims 0 and 1. This is used only if `dim`
      is 0 or 1.

  Returns:
    The `z_list` with its `plane` boundary on the low side and corresponding

    z_list: A list of length nz of tensors of shape (nx, ny), where nx, ny and
      nz are the number of points along the axes of a (sub)grid.
    dims: The dimensions or axes along which halo exchange will be performed.
      This is a sequence containing some or all of 0, 1, 2 (corresponding to x,
      y, z).
    replica_id: The replica id.
    replicas: A numpy array of replicas.
    replica_dims: The dimensions of `replicas` along which halo exchange will be
      performed.
    periodic_dims: If not `None`, must be a boolean vector with the same length
      as replica_dims. Indicates whether the particular dimension uses periodic
      boundary conditions.
    boundary_conditions: The boundary conditions to apply. If `None`, the
      boundary will be set to 0. See more info about boundary conditions below.
    width: The width of halo to exchange.
    left_padding: The amount of left padding, referring the 2d plane formed by
      dims 0 and 1 (left is dim 1).
    top_padding: The amount of top padding, referring to the 2d plane formed by
      dims 0 and 1 (top is dim 0).  If boundary_conditions is not `None` it must
      have the form  [ [(BCType for dim 0 lower bound, value for dim 0 lower
      bound), (BCType for dim 0 upper bound, value for dim 0 upper bound)],
      [(BCType for dim1 lower bound, value for dim 1 lower bound), (BCType for
      dim1 upper bound, value for dim 1 upper bound)], ... ]  Note the innermost
      sequence can be `None`, in which case the corresponding boundary will be
      set to zero. Also, boundary conditions only apply when the corresponding
      dimension is not periodic. The value can be a float, or can be a sequence
      of planes of length `width`. An element of this sequence is a tensor if
      dim = 2 (z-axis) and a sequence if dim is 0 or 1. A z-axis boundary plane
      is specified by a 2D tensor of shape (nx, ny). A 2D x- or y-axis boundary
      plane is specified by a list of length nz of tensors of shape (1, ny) or
      (nx, 1), respectively. The order of planes in the sequence is from low to
      high along the dimension `dim`. This means for a low boundary the
      innermost plane is the last or `width - 1` element in the sequence. For a
      high boundary the innermost plane is the 0th element.  In the Neumann case
      the grid spacing is not taken into account, so the value specified by the
      constant or the 2D plane(s) should take into account the grid spacing as
      appropriate.  Halo exchange / applying boundary conditions is done one
      plane at a time for performance reasons. If width > 1 a single tensor of
      shape (e.g.) (nx, ny, width) could be exchanged. This was implemented but,
      when width = 1, was found to be slow compared to the original width = 1
      implementation. By doing halo exchange plane by plane the performance is
      the same as the original implementation in the most common and important
      width = 1 case.

  Returns:
    The incoming z_list modified to include the result of halo exchange and
      taking boundary conditions into account.
